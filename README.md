# SUNP-GLM_AED

Start-Up Code is a collection of other peoples code for GLM-AED at Sunapee. I will base calibrations for GLM-AED off of this. Using a combination of Whitney and Nicole's parameters. We then spent time going through the params with Quinn and Cayelan. Mary has helped a lot with this so far. 


Everything needed to run GLM-AED for Sunapee is in the SUNP_GLM_AED folder.
